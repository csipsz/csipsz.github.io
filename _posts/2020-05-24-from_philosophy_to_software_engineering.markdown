Before I moved to the United States I was studying Philosophy at Piliscsaba, a small university town a few miles away from Budapest. I loved every minute of it, but my absolute favourite subjects were German Idealism, Greek and Roman Philosophy. I could write a longer list of interests but in short I felt really close to Continental Philosophy.

After finishing my Master's degree I was standing in front of the biggest junction of my life: Stay in Hungary and continue my studies  or choose my other passion, which is travelling and seeing the world.
I decided to live with the opportunity that I had and moved to the United States. But I wasn't sure if Philosophy was what I wanted to do here. A reason behind my decision is the fact that Analytic Philosophy is the main tradition in the Anglosphere. I came from Europe with a deep love for Continental Philosophy. Analytic Philosophy has amazing achievements, and Wittgenstein, Russell, Kripke and Frege are all great writers and the list doesn't stop there... Still, I didn't know how much interest there would be in American Institutions for research on my favorite Continental philosophers.

My husband gave me the idea that I should try out programming. I had my doubts because I studied humanities before and I didn't have any real interest in computers or in technology before.
The first time when I realized that coding might not be as far from me as I thought was when I started to learn Python. I saw that it has very similar concepts to what I learned in my Symbolic Logic classes. Logic always fascinated me, and I saw how it can be used in critical thinking in the everyday life. But now it was unfolding in front of me how far you can get if you apply Boole's logic in modern day technology almost two centuries later.
It was always very evident for me that Philosophy is not dead nor just a luxury, but now I had the revelation that it is interweaved with Computer Science. So I started to spend more time exploring this new-found hobby.

What pushed me toward applying to Flatiron School was the time when I connected my first JavaScript, HTML and CSS files and saw how you can create a small application within a matter of hours by typing a few elements, adding a few styles and writing a few boolean values, variables and loops. The complexity made out of a few lines of code was just mesmerizing. I came from Philosophy, I love rules, I love systems, I love Logic... So I felt very happy when I submitted my application and even happier when I got accepted.

Another thing that is very appealing to me in Software Development is that how dynamic it is. I don't think that Philosophy is a closed book or lost its relevance, but it is certainly not living its Renaissance now. But programming is. It is developing incredibly fast and new ideas are born every day right in front of our eyes. I find this amazing, and I just wish to be a part of it.
