I am sure that every one of us had a very unique experience while working on the First Mile. Some students have already done some coding before, and for others everything is new and challenging. We share the intimidating time limit, the frustration over getting stuck while working through the same lessons, and our time learning together. But otherwise we have very different coding styles. These are the things that helped me during the First Mile.

The most important thing doesn't have to do a lot with problem solving or logical thinking. It was perceptional. I don't see the First Mile or the upcoming modules as a problem opposed to me. I think of it as a problem that is on my side and I care for it. The First Mile helped me to practice problem solving, improving my coding skills, and it helped me decide if this is what I really want to do.

To make it through all of the lessons, my keyword was time. Only one out of the whole group can say that there is no one ahead of me. It follows from this statistical fun fact that it is highly likely that there will be students ahead of me, and that can feel disheartening because I'd like to keep up the pace. But I know that speed won't help me, it will just give me a disservice. Instead of coding faster, I just code more. Other students might have experience with what I am learning, and they also took their time when they started. So I remind myself to take my own. Moving on without understanding the previous concepts will make everything more difficult. I like to leave more time than what I think I really need because unexpected problems often caused me to lose a lot of time that I previously thought I had.

With solving labs, some of my steps are very trivial, but I think they are still important. First I read all of the instructions and make sure that I understand what is expected from my code. If something is not clear, I look into the Rspec file to find more information, what should be my return value, or what is the datatype of the argument that is passed into my method.

I think that Pry is not crucial to finish the First Mile, but it is an amazing tool to make the process easier. It is here to help, and not something to be worried about. Pry was mostly a learning by doing it thing for me. I realized that sometimes I don't need to understand everything in advance, it is just easier to experiment and see what something does in my code once it's there. You can be an ornithologist to know when will your goose lay eggs, or you can be a farmer. If it works it works.

In the beginning I was terrified from all of the error messages in my terminal, but later on I started to see how useful they are if you read them carefully. If I don't get an error message that I find informative, I just break my code to get another one.

When I am overwhelmed with a lab and with all of the new things that I just learnt I just try to build up my code from lower level methods. There is nothing wrong with using each to build up a method to understand the logic, and implement it later with a different enumerable. The problem starts if I stop at the first working version. I always aim to revisit my code and make it better later and I like to see other implementations as well. Understanding how others think is a very important skill, and sometimes it can show me solutions that are far better than my own.

The last essential thing for me is repeating the lessons. It might feel like a setback, but instead of thinking of it as running in circles I like to think of it as a spiral. Even though I was here a few days ago, the same lesson has details that I missed for the first time, and I can get to a higher level of understanding than before. And that is progression after all.
