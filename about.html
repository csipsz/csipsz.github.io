<p>My name is Luca. I grew up in Budapest, Hungary and studied philosophy there. I moved to the United States a few years ago and developed a passion for Software Engineering in the last year. I really enjoy working on back end problems and find the problem solving that comes with programming very inspiring. I am very excited to learn about programming because it  is an ever growing profession with endless possibilities for creativity and thinking.</p>
